Preliminary title.
Background to the assignment. Why is it relevant?
Aim for the work. What should be accomplished?
The formulation of the problem at hand, the assignment. This should include and extended version of the scientific problem definition and references to knowledge within

Include Time plan/ resources/ project risks
Include coarse grained planing and fine grained tasks that have to be achieved.

- Quality is more important than quantity
- Investigate the most exotic touch points and define the relevant KPIs that can be hard to measure: this is the innovation in this thesis.

Talk to Mathias

Find and get touch points


Feedback about the presentation: Include dimensional levels,  entities : It is not only about what the operators does but also about the social environment, the friends etc..
Discussion also about the results of the thesis, the areas that should be included e.g advertising, promotions and so on

Other sources: Eridoc, Business Intelligence and Consumer lab

KPIs and how to be calibrated


create an index score for each touch point
create Confidence score: how confident are we about the score based on available input data
Ideal validation is to be done as part of the future work, mentioned in the thesis.
Technical validation is what will be done.

Measurement ways
Total experience index

OPEN DATA idea

Meeting with Mattias
Find the MSDP product and get some info from it
Getting more tangible KPIs and measurable ones.
Surveys problems is response rate and only non satisfied customers respond ..
Hierarchical Recommendations or referrals from customers to other customers
Adding another column about customer point of view of this KPIs (using RFGs etc)
Product catalogue investigation, mcommerce amdocs, oracle etc
